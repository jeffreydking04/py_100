# This is lesson 23 from Henrick Johansson's Master Pandas and Python for Data Handling

# Python Object Oriented Programming I: Some Theory

# Objects contain data and code
# Reusable, scalable, and efficient

# Uses classes to define objects

# A created object from a class is called an instance (infinite number)

# A class or object holding data is called encapsulation, protection from contamination by neighboring values.

# Classes can be derived from other classes by inheritance.

# Classes derived from other classes may have different methods than those in the base class.  

# Classes may have different versions of the same methods, but with different parameters. This is polymorphism.

# Objects created by constructors; destroyed by a destructor.

# In Python everything is intended to be an objects.

# In Python, everything is public as as a default standard.

# Method access types:
# Standard
# Protected
# Private
