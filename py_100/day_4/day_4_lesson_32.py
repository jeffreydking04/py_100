# oh nice; she is ordering the list by date of entry to the union
# really difficult for us to have any knowledge of that though
# alphabetical might be a better learning tool

# so indexing by 0; I hope she has something new for me

# She does! Index as offset.  The first item is not offset, so 0.

# negative indices are the offset from the end, but the 'end' is the next element after the last, which is imaginary
