Immediately thought of a use for the flow chart creator beyond its initial scope.
Writing. A section can have one main theme, or it can introduce many new ideas to expound on later.
An intro might be a split or it might be a step.  We can visualize the flow of the text.
My writing in the past has often been of the variety where I pique the reader's interest early,
but save my actual thesis for the conclusion.  This theoretically works by connecting the conclusion back to
the introduction, but even if the 'flow' is more linear than that, we can still visualize a piece of writing with
a flow chart.

I am not even sure we need to expand the syntax.  If a section has multiple ideas, it is a split with many targets.

I used it and got a great diagram for the Deep Dive on Velocity, but it revealed some distinct flaws.  Creating a
user interface to create csvs for specific purposes is a great idea, but for now this works.
